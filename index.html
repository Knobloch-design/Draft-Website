        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
         &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The objective of this project was to identify ways to decrease medical insurance costs.
        Health insurance protects against unexpected medical emergency costs which, according to healthcare.gov, costs  9.12% of a worker's paycheck on average.
        Emergencies, pre-existing health conditions, lifestyle choices, and location could all have an effect on why the medical bills are high or low.
        Discovering what aspects increase medical insurance bills can help prevent or to plan for health insurance bills in the future.
        Our findings reveal attributes that could cost patients up to $20,000 more than average per year.

        <div class="panel">
          <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;We have all seen that crytocurrency prices can swing wildly at the drop at the of a hat but is so new as an asset class
             that the vast majority of people don't understand how it works. Understanding what the factors that affect the price of
             crytocurrencies like bitcoin are all built apon a protical call the 'Block Chain'. Block Chain means that every transaction
             is recorded and publicly sharedy with everyone inside of any block, so that all transactions can be varified by the entire network.
             The network can be thought about as a random third party that has a computer. They use their computer to add you transaction to a block
             and then put said block at the top of the block chain. Every block will also contain a lock at the bottom who purpose is to ensure that it
             is more difficult for naer-do-wells not at false blocks onto the top of the block chain. Every lock has a key however, so the goal
             of every crytocurrency miner is to find that key before anyone else so they can claim a small portion of crytocurrency as a reward for their efforts.
             Here in lies the crux of my quesiton, which is how much do it actually cost to find the key to put a new block on to the block chain.
             The answer to this question is the theoretical bottom to the price of any crytocurrency as no miner is going to front the costs of all the
             electricly it costs to run their computer if it is just going to lose them money.

          <h2>Keyboards:</h2>
          <p> &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;I build custom mechanical keyboards for fun! I add modifications that improve a keyboard's feel, look,
             and sound that all come together to create a personalized and unique desk piece. As a Computer Engineering student,
              I spend a lot of days sitting at my computer. I resolved that if, because of my love of programming, I was going to spend
               much of my day at my desk then I would want that experience to be as comfortable and as enjoyable as possible.
              After modifying my old corsair membrane keyboard as much as I possible could, I finally was gifted a mechanical keyboard
              by an old friend and immediately tore it apart. I watched countless YouTube videos and scoured forums just learning what
              was possible and that a keyboard could be so much more. After putting everything back together the changes in the sound
             and feel I made in the keyboard blew me away. I was hooked and now I love keyboards and I love building them for people.
            
          </p>
          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;If anyone reading this is looking to get started with a custom mechanical keyboard, I can help.
             Send me an email at alecknobloch28@gmail.com to commission me to help walk you through the process and built you
              a unique custom mechanical keyboard that will be all your own. </p>
